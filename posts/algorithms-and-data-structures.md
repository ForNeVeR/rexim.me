Here I'm going to collect the links to my posts about any algorithms
and data structures. Even the simplest ones.

I actually believe in immortality of algorithms and data
structures. New technologies and programming languages are being
created and dying every day. On the other hand, algorithms and data
structures usually live a very long life. For example, the
[Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)
was invented in 300 BC and still remains in use.
