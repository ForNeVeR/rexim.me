description: Explains how to insert a link to an org-mode document by URL from the clipboard.

After exporting my bookmarks
[from Firefox to an org-mode document](/firefox-bookmarks-to-org-mode.html)
I started to use Emacs as a bookmark manager. After a couple of days,
I realized that I needed to automate some things. I didn't want to
just insert new URLs to the org-mode document. I wanted to insert them
as the org-mode
[links](http://orgmode.org/manual/Link-format.html). It requires to
write the description by myself. And it is more complex than just
`CTRL+C`, `CTRL+V` the URL.
