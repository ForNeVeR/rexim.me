description: A post about one interesting task I was doing at my job.

I was participating in development of our local dictionary of
organizations with a city map like [2gis](http://2gis.com/). My last
task was probably the most interesting task for the whole year of
work. I was contributing to a part of our infrastructure intended for
searching the shortest paths on transport routes of a city.
